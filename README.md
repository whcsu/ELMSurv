We use the Buckley-James method to impute the data and extend the emerging Extreme Learning Machine approach to survival analysis. Currently, only right censored data are supported. For a detailed information, see the paper "A Survival Ensemble of Extreme Learning Machine" by Hong Wang, Jianxin Wang and Lifeng Zhou (2017)<DOI: 10.1007/s10489-017-1063-4>, which will appear in Applied Intelligence(https://link.springer.com/journal/10489) soon.
